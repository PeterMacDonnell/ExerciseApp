Project Description: A health and fitness app that allows users to input their information, set their goals, and track nutrition intake. 
Features We Plan to Have:

1) Users come to site, choose goal, and input health information
    - Create landing page
    - Create large buttons on landing page where users can choose their goal
    - Create form for users to input health information and push to Firebase

2) Users can track their macros (protein, carbohydrates, fats, maybe calories). Potentially use chart.js to provide graphics.
    - Use Google Auth to have users login so they can see their individual information
    - Use Edamam's food database API to allow users to input foods and track total numbers of macros

3) Users can get recommended recipes to fill thier macros (Edamam)
    - Use Edamam's API to pull recipes that will help fill their macro totals for the day. These searches will be based on user data from previous inputs.

4) Use the Google Maps or a hiking trails API to recommend places to walk/run based on users location

5) Users can search YouTube videos of excersizes to target certain body parts
    - Create buttons for users to select body parts to target and then provide YouTube videos wtih exercises to target that body part.

API's to be used: Edamam, Google Maps or hiking trail, YouTube
